## 1. Overview

OpenUIR (Open User Interface Representation) is an open specification for describing user interfaces and user interaction via a retained, instruction-driven model.

OpenUIR is not a UI framework. It defines no runtime, no rendering engine, and no programming model.

Instead, OpenUIR defines:
- What a UI *is*
- How it is *represented*
- How it is *mutated*
- How interaction is *reported*

The Core Profile defines the minimal instruction set and semantics required for interoperability.
