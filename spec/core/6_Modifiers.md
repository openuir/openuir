## 6. Modifiers

Modifiers alter the appearance or layout behavior of a node.

Modifiers are explicit and non-inheriting.

Core modifiers include:

- padding
- opacity
- cornerRadius
- border
- background

Modifiers MUST be applied only to the node they are attached to.

Backends MUST NOT infer implicit modifier inheritance.
