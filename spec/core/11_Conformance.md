## 10. Conformance

A backend claiming OpenUIR 1.0 Core Profile compliance MUST:

- Implement all core elements
- Implement all core layouts
- Support stable NodeIDs
- Support all core events
- Correctly apply all core instructions

A backend MUST NOT claim Core Profile compliance if any required feature is missing.

Partial implementations MUST identify themselves as non-conformant.
