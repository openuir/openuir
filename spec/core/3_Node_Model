### 3.1 Nodes

All UI is composed of nodes.

- A stable NodeID
- A node type
- Zero or more properties
- Zero or more child nodes

### 3.2 Node Identity

NodeIDs MUST be:
- Globally unique within a UI tree
- Stable across updates
- Producer-defined

Backends MUST NOT generate NodeIDs.

### 3.3 Tree Semantics

The UI tree is:
- Ordered
- Hierarchical
- Retained

Instruction order MUST NOT be used to infer tree structure.
